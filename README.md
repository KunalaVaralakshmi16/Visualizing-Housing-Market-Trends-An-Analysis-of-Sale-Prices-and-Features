# 🏠 Visualizing Housing Market Trends: An Analysis of Sale Prices and Features (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Visualizing Housing Market Trends** project focuses on exploring and analyzing housing sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between property features and sale prices. Using **Tableau**, this project transforms raw housing datasets into interactive dashboards that support data-driven insights for buyers, sellers, real estate analysts, and policymakers.

The project emphasizes understanding how structural characteristics, neighborhood factors, and market conditions influence housing prices over time.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze housing sale price distributions and identify key influencing factors
* Examine relationships between property features (size, rooms, age, location) and prices
* Identify temporal trends and seasonal patterns in housing sales
* Create interactive dashboards to support exploratory analysis and decision-making
* Present meaningful visual insights for stakeholders in the real estate market

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project typically contains residential housing transaction records with attributes such as:

* Sale Price
* Sale Date
* Lot Area
* Overall Quality Rating
* Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms
* Garage Capacity
* Year Built / Age of Property
* Neighborhood / Location
* Total Living Area

This structured dataset enables multidimensional analysis across property features and time.
